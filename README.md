# Draggable & Resizable

Your mission (should you choose to accept it), is to give the div "main" the option to move by dragging the header, and resize itself by dragging its border.

# Requirements

* Clicking on the div with the id="header" and dragging it with the whole “main” div.

* The box shouldn't move beyond the borderlines of the viewport. exmpale: if the box touches the right border it stops moving right but can still move any other direction.

* When resizing with any corner/border of the box, the opposite corner/border should remain in place and the other corners/borders should be adjusted respectively (like windows). when handling the top corners the box should only resize! not move!

* While resizing, the box shouldn't grow beyond the borders. if it touches any border it cannot grow to that diriction any more.

* The box can't shrink to less then 150 over 150 px.

* If the mouse isn't clicked, nothing should happen.

* Don't use any outside librarys. this project is vanilla only.

Good luck!
